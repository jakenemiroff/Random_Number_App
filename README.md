# Random Number App

This is the first android app I've built using Kotlin.

This app allows the user to increment and display a value to the layout,
and generates a randomly generated value between 0 and the incremented value.

In terms of a first project I really enjoyed this one and recommend it to others looking to learn Kotlin!

These are some of the things I learned while developing this intro app:

	-How to use the layout editor.
	
	-How to set property values.
	
	-How to add resources.
	
	-How to add new views to the layout.
	
	-How to constrain the position of a view to another view.
	
	-How to find a view by its ID.
	
	-How to add click listeners for a view.
	
	-How to set and get property values of a view from your code.
	
	-How to find a view by its ID.
	
	-How to add click listeners for a view.
	
	-How to pass information to a second fragment.
